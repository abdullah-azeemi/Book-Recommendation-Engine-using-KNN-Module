This machine learning project belongs to FreeCodeCamp.org and is part of their Machine Learning with Python certification. 
The initial code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, and testing the book recommendation function was provided by FreeCodeCamp.org. 
The project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to create personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and book ratings. 
By leveraging the vast dataset containing 1.1 million ratings of 270,000 books by 90,000 users, 
         the project demonstrates the effectiveness of KNN in delivering relevant book suggestions to users.
